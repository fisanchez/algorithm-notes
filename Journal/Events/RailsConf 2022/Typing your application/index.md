---

**Wtf is Sorbet**
- Type checker for Ruby
- Allows for gradual typing
- Syntax 100% Ruby
- Developed by Stripe

**Gradual typgin**
Type system 


**Why Sobert at Shopify**
Large codebase
Thousands of Engineers

Sobert unlocks the following:
- Gradual typing
- Fast type checking
- VS Code integration
- More safety, peace of mind

**Why not RBS**
- RBS isn't a tool, it's a language
- RBS isn't valid Ruby code
_It's easier to go from one type system to another rather than not having types to having types_

**Per-file type strinctness**
Sigil is a magic comment at the top of a Ruby file used to set type strictness

[Tools](./Tools/index)
Static type checking component of Sorbet

sobert-runtime
