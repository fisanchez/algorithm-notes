# How to ace the technical interview

## REACTO method
**Repeat the question**
When you're interviewing people like to ask a question they're comfortable with. Repeat the question so the things you don't understand you can work with the intervier

**Examples**
Write examples. Create a two column table, "given these parameters this is what I'm expecting"

**Approach**
Describe your approaches. Give the interviwer some context and you will be able to read your interviewer's reaction to guide if you're on the right track. Then confirm your approach.

**Code**
Write your code.  
Breadth first coding: A hack - decompose your approach to high level functions instead of imparitive things you are doing. You can get caught up on small things that are not worth spending the time on.

Tips: 
- Leave yourself room between each line for edits
