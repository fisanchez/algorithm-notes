- Class 2 machines
	- Kinda weird. These machines are usually used where normal slot machines are banned.
	- It's kind of like an electronic Bingo game
- Class 3
	- 100 percent random using RNG.
	- Once you start rolling it already calculated your wins/loses
	- Truely random, past performance doesn't influence it
