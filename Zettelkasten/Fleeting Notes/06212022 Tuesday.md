### Recurring payments
At a high level:
-   Assets will be identified as subscriptions
-   Assets will have asset feature metadata that identify them as recurring billing assets
-   For initial delivery for Fall Rush, 2022, we will support credit card payments through Stripe for recurring billing subscription purchases
    -   PayPal support is out of scope
    -   Apple Pay/Stripe Wallet transactions are out of scope
    -   Watchman/Financial Aid transactions are out of scope
-   We are building the following two Stripe features:
    -   Apple Pay via Stripe (VST-26899)
        -   This is true at a code level, even though the feature itself will not be used immediately for recurring payments
    -   Saved Payments via Stripe (VST-28109)
-   Pricing will be as normal through Manage / Catalogs

This feature will leverage Stripe's subscription management functionality and work as follows:
-   A user purchases a recurring payment asset
-   Stargate saves payment information for that purchased asset
    -   NB: This means the Stripe payment_intent and payment_method, not raw card data
		<span style="color:red">
		When do we create a new payment intent using the payment_method?
		</span>
-   On a regular schedule, based on asset duration (e.g. 30 days):
    -   Stripe bills the customer for the next interval
    -   Stripe sends Stargate a webhook indicating the user has been charged
    -   Stargate extends the license
    -   Stargate sends a transactional email to the user
-   Subscriptions will be managed via Stripe's end-user facing subscription management UI
    -   Updating billing method
    -   Subscription cancellation
    -   Users will be given an authenticated redirect from Account Center, through Stargate, to Stripe
-   Stargate will handle refunds since this work happens through Stripe, however, Jiffy and Manage will need to review and potentially adjust refund qualification rules
    -   e.g. 14 days after initial purchase and some percent unread
    -   Subsequent billing will only allow cancellation of billing, but not prorate a refund


**TLDR**
- Subscription will be handled by Stripe's UI
- Stargate will handle refunds
- Stargate saves `payment_method` and `payment_intent` from purchased asset




### Code

**Stripes controller**

`payment_creator.response`  =>
`payment_creator_service.run` =>

```ruby
PaymentServices::Creator.new(
	pending_purchase_attributes: pending_purchase_attributes,
	service: PaymentServices::Stripe,
	service_attributes: params
).run
```


The update method calls `PaymentServices::Creator.response` ?
