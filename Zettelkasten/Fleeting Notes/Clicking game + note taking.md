Thinking an idea about combining a note taking app with a clicker game or afk styled games. We don't want the focus to be the game, rather an initative to finish more tasks.

Why:

- I love video games, especially clicker games

Idea:

- Completeing tasks give clicking boosts, etc

Possbile tasks:
- Create a prototype using Rails Turbo
