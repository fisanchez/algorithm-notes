## Todo 
- [x] Add translations to 40739
- [x] Deploy bulk dev tickets, VST-40739 + VST-40846 + VST-40850
- [ ] Create async action to retrieve billing details
- [ ] Dispatch update method that creates pending_transaction


## Notes

**How update works now**
After filling billing details and clicking continue it triggers the following method:

`dispatch(update(data))`

Data:
```json
{
    "city": "Atlanta",
    "country": "US",
    "firstName": "Ash",
    "g-recaptcha-response": null,
    "institutionId": null,
    "lastName": "Ketchum",
    "secondaryAddress": null,
    "state": "GA",
    "streetAddress": "10 Poke st",
    "zip": "30318"
}
```

Data from api
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "Ash",
    "lastName": "Ketchum",
    "address1": "10 Happy St",
    "address2": null,
    "city": "Atlanta",
    "state": "GA",
    "country": "US",
    "postalCode": "30318",
    "savedPaymentMethodId": 1,
    "createdAt": "2022-06-10T19:02:16.002Z",
    "updatedAt": "2022-06-10T19:02:16.002Z"
}
```

**Repeat billing meeting**

Subscription is not always repeat billing

We are only doing bridge subscription 

We need to support
- Recurring billing
	- Dependant on two things
		- Alex apple pay
		- Saved pay methods

Do we allow the user to save multiple saved methods
- We just want to allow credit cards
- For launch we will do one saved pay method
	- We will probably need multiple payment methods sooner than later

- We need to allow to pass refunds to account center
- Need to support canceling repeat billling
- Handle changing changing payment
- Pricing needs to be relfected by catalog but we have to process these changes and make them displayed on PDP
- Management of subscripion would be through stripe since they have a subscripion API
- We need to listen to Stripe webhooks
	- Stripe will tell us when to charge, we will listen for a webhook then fire a lisence extension call


**Things to ask Nathan**
- How do you speed up RSpec tests
