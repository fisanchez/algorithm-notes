## Todo 
- [x] Set default state `hasSavedPayment` for logged in user
- [x] Create selector for hasSavedPayment
- [ ] Create async action to retrieve billing details




## Notes

### Questions
- How do I set default state from the server
The serializer helps with params of the React component method.
For example checkout serializer new props need to be added to the state method.

```ruby
# components/checkout.rb
def state; end
```




- How to make an async call from a react component

---

What I want to do
- Before dispatching the `switchToBillingAddressStep` method, we want to 
- make an API call to determine if the user has an existing customer in `CreditCardPaymentButton.jsx`
- If it does, go ahead and popualte the rest of the field


I need a React component to talk to the server.  Do we have any examples of other components trying to do this on our app? 

Happy Friday, Andrew! 

I have a question - I'm trying to get a React component to make a request to the server. Do you know if we have any examples of other components trying to do the same?

I was thinking of making an axios request from the component, but that just feels..wrong? 

I'm trying to populate payment details after clicking on the "Credit Card" payment type button.

What I could:
Set boolean in state determing whether or not the customer has a saved payment.



### Blocking ip address on rack attack
- Have request throttling dashboard for stargate
- Raw number that are being throtttled
- They're either getting 429 if Rack attack has limited them
- Or if there's a hard ip level block = 403
- Is our usual throughput out of the ordinary?

### Misc notes
***What is dispatch function***
This is the only way to trigger an action and the only way to change state using redux.

Hitting CC button will dispatch to `switchToBillingAddressStep` 

```js
// reducers.js
const switchToBillingAddressStep = state => ({
  ...state,
  activeStep: FORM_STEPS.billingAddress,
  allowCartEditing: true,
  chosenPaymentType: state.creditCardPaymentGateway,
  cybersourceData: null,
  pendingPurchaseTransactionUuid: null,
  stripeErrors: []
})
```
