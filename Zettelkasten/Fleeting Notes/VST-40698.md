Content displayed while hovering over an element must be
- Persistant
> Stay visable while remaining over the element and not disappear
- Hoverable
> The new displayed content must remain visable as long as the cursor remains over element
- Dismissable
> The user should be able to dismiss the content without needing to move the mouse. This can be done by pressing the escape key for example.


**reason**
- People with mobility impairments may find it difficult to read the content if the content disappears too quickly 
- Users might also trigger the content without meaning to and should have an alternative way to remove the hoverable content

**our problem**
In the _My Cart_ view, hovering over the information icon opens a tooltip with text but this text disappears when hovering into it.

**solution**
We need to make sure the content generated remains on screen when it is being hovered on


**How to meet standards**
1.  @@ ARIA: Using role="tooltip"
2. @@ CSS: Using hover and focus pseudo classes
